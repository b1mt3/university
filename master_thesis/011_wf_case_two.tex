\subsection{Case 2: Connectivity by means of multiple device-to-device relay links}
Conditioning on the nearest serving base station being at the distance \(r_1\), and the nearest D2D node for each mobile user being at a distance \(r_2\), we may come to an expression:
\[\P\Bigg[h\ge\frac{N_u\Theta_u (d_u^1)^{-\beta_u}}{P_u}\Big|d_u^1=r_2\Bigg]\]
\[\times\dots\]
\[\times\P\Bigg[h\ge\frac{N_b\Theta_b d_b^{-\beta_b}}{P_b}\Big|d_b=r_1,\bigcap\limits_{k=1}^{n}\P\Big[h\ge\frac{N_u\Theta_u (d_u^n)^{-\beta_u}}{P_u}\Big|d_u^n=r_2\Big]\Bigg]\]
