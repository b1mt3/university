\section{Problem Statement and Performance characteristics}
\subsection{System model}
The study considers 2 independent homogeneous stationary Poisson point processes with given densities:
\begin {enumerate}
  \item $(\Phi_b, \lambda_b)$ - set of base stations;
  \item $(\Phi_u, \lambda_u)$ - set of mobile users.
\end {enumerate}
Respective initial parameters (a transmission power $P$, a signal propagation exponent $\beta$, a thermal noise value $N$ and a service threshold $\Theta$) are also given:
\begin {enumerate}
  \item $(P_b, \beta_b, N_b, \Theta_b)$ - parameters of the base stations;
  \item $(P_u, \beta_u, N_u, \Theta_u)$ - parameters of the mobile users.
\end {enumerate}
The random channel effects include only a Rayleigh fading with a mean 1. 
The environment is noise-limited. 
The receiver is located at the origin $o$ of $\R^2$. 
The location of the nearest base station is denoted as $B_{nst}$. 
The distance between the receiver and its nearest serving base station is denoted as $d_b$. 
The distance between 2 mobile users located near each other is denoted as $d_u$. 
The objective is to calculate the performance of the link between the receiver and it nearest serving base station.

\subsection{Performance evaluation}
The main performance characteristics in this model is Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR):
\[SNR=\frac {S}{N}\text{,}\]
representing the signal with the necessary message (\(S\)) and the thermal noise of the transmitter (\(N\)). 
For scenarios without fading the SNR would look like:
\[SNR_{nf}=\frac {S}{N}=\frac {P\times d^{-\beta}}{N}\text{,}\]
where \(P\) is a transmission power of a node, \(d^{-\beta}\) -- a path-loss function, comprised of the distance between the nodes \(d\) and the signal propagation exponent \(\beta\).
\\ For scenarios involving the fading effect, a random variable \(h\) is incorporated that follows an exponential distribution with mean \(1/\mu\) \Big(\(h\sim \exp(\mu)\)\Big):
\[SNR_f=\frac {P\times h\times d^{-\beta}}{N}\]
The purpose of the thesis is to consider the following probabilities:
\begin {equation}
  p_{nf}=\P\Big[SNR_{nf}\ge\Theta\Big]
\end {equation}

\begin {equation}
  p_f=\P\Big[SNR_f\ge\Theta\Big]
\end {equation}
