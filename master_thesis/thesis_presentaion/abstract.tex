  \begin{itemize}
    \item Device-to-device (D2D) enables direct communication between nearby mobiles;
    \item D2D improves spectrum utilization, energy efficiency, coverage and overall throughput;
    \item Thesis considers D2D cellular network in comparison with the traditional cellular network;
    \item Model consists of independent homogeneous Poisson point processes with contact distance probability and noise-limited environment;
    \item Analytical way of calculating performance is developed;
    \item Using analytical results, numerical experiments are carried out and results are displayed.
