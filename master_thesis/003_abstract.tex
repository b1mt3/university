Device-to-device (D2D) communication enables direct communication between nearby mobiles that improves spectrum utilization, overall throughput and energy efficiency. The thesis considers the performance of the D2D communication, i.e. connectivity with the aid of mobile users acting as signal relays, and compares with direct cellular link. Using stochastic geometry, a model of independent homogeneous Poisson point processes is made with the incorporation of contact distance probability, Rayleigh fading and a noise-limited environment. As a result, a connectivity performance is obtained. Also, in order to represent the achieved result, a series of numerical experiments were carried out and are displayed in the thesis.
